Overview: This project involves creating a basic web page that mimics some core functionalities of a music streaming service like Spotify. The focus is on using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a simple yet functional music player interface. This project is ideal for understanding basic web development concepts and frontend interactivity.

Core Features:

Header:

Displays the name of the application, e.g., "My Music App".
Playback Controls:

Play: A button to start or resume playing a track.
Pause: A button to stop the track (not implemented in this basic version, but typically included).
Next: A button to move to the next track in the list.
Previous: A button to return to the previous track.
Track List:

A section where the available tracks are listed. This list is generated dynamically using JavaScript.
Footer:

Displays a simple copyright notice or any other relevant information.
Technical Aspects:

HTML: Provides the basic structure of the webpage. It includes sections for the header, main content area with playback controls, and a footer.
CSS: Applies styling to make the application visually appealing. This includes layout adjustments, button styling, and general aesthetics.
JavaScript: Manages the interaction logic for playback controls. It dynamically updates the track list and handles user interactions with the buttons.
Implementation Notes:

HTML: Structure is straightforward with semantic elements to organize the layout (header, main, footer).
CSS: Focuses on basic styling for layout and buttons. It ensures the application is easy to navigate and visually clean.
JavaScript: Provides basic functionality for the play, next, and previous buttons. It uses console logs for testing purposes and dynamically generates a list of tracks.
